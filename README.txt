Persistent Forking (WordPress plugin)

Persistent Forking allows contributors of your site to create
permanent "forks" of existing posts. Every fork is a full-fledged
post in its own right and can be published as such. This
distinguishes Persistent Forking from the "Post Forking" plugin,
where forks are a collaborative tool in order to arrive at a single
definitive version. The parent-child relationships between posts are
tracked and it is possible to visualise the entire family tree of a
post.


INSTALLATION

Just copy the plugin to your wp-content/plugins directory, then
enable the plugin in your admin panel.


SUPPORT

Please report any issue that you find while using the plugin at our
GitHub repository:

https://github.com/UUDigitalHumanitieslab/persistent-forking/issues

The first priority of the Digital Humanities Lab is to service
requests from Humanities researchers at Utrecht University. However,
the plugin is open source with a liberal license, so anyone can
provide a patch if we don't follow up on your issue.
